# RateWatch â€” Fixed-Income News Monitor (Python)

Built a Python tool that pulls Fed/BLS/Treasury/Reuters headlines, filters for rates/credit, tags quick risk-on/off tone, and outputs a one-page digest for pre-open and data/auction windows.  
Cut manual scanning and standardized auction/policy monitoring, improving pre-open and post-print readiness for the desk.

## What it does

- Curates headlines from Fed, BLS, U.S. Treasury, and Reuters.
- Time-bounded view (last X hours) to match trading windows.
- Keyword focus on rates/credit; quick risk-on/off/neutral tag.
- One-page digest to console; optional Slack delivery.
